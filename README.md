# Personal Website of ZionChik

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, a platform to showcase my programming journey, projects, and technical expertise. The site is designed with a focus on clean design, responsive behavior, and user-centric navigation.

## Overview

This website is more than just a portfolioâ€”it's a reflection of my growth as a developer. Starting with basic projects in Scratch, I have since expanded my skills to include modern technologies like C#, JavaScript, and responsive web design.

Key features of the site include:

- A dynamic and interactive main page for an engaging user experience.
- Direct links to my professional and personal social media profiles.
- An "About Me" section sharing my journey and focus areas.
- Access to earlier versions of the website for comparison and evolution tracking.

## Technologies

The site is built with:

- HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
- JavaScript for interactivity and user experience enhancements.
- A responsive layout to ensure usability on different devices.
- Google Analytics integration for user behavior tracking.

## Structure

The repository includes the following:

- `index.html`: Main entry point of the site.
- `styles.css`: Styling for all pages.
- `birthdayCounter.js`: A JavaScript feature for displaying dynamic content.
- Additional resources like images, icons, and archived versions of the website.

## What Makes This Project Unique?
